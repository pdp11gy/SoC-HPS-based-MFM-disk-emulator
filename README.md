# SoC-HPS-based-MFM-disk-emulator
 MFM disk emulator ( ST506, ST412, ST225 )  based on DE10-Nano  board
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
This is a new follow-up project from the RL01 / RL02 disk emulator, also based on SoC/HPS             
environment with the DE10-Nano board: https://github.com/pdp11gy/SoC-HPS-based-RL-disk-emulator .          
It is based on the DE10-Nano with a different I/O interface. Details on my homepage, www.pdp11gy.com    
After extracting the file MFM-disk_Emulator_SoC.zip, you will find all sources. It's also based on
Quartus Version 16.1. **Please note , this project is in the beta state**                                          
There are still some open points which are briefly described in the sources of the MFM decoders            
MFM_gap_DECODER_V1_0.v and CL_my_MFM_DEcoder_V1_0.v. At the moment I don't have the possibility for      
further analyze this problem in the DEC environment because I lack the location and the hardware.              
Maybe there will be cooperation. Any hint is welcome. An exact problem description will follow shortly.
