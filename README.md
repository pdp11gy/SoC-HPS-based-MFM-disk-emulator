# SoC-HPS-based-MFM-disk-emulator
 MFM disk emulator ( ST506, ST412, ST225 )  based on DE10-Nano  board                          
 This is a new follow-up project from the RL01 / RL02 disk emulator, 
 https://github.com/pdp11gy/SoC-HPS-based-RL-disk-emulator .  It is also based on the DE10-Nano
 with a different I/O interface. Hardware details on my homepage, www.pdp11gy.com
